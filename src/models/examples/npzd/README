This example is a proof of concept carried out at AED/UWA (https://aed.see.uwa.edu.au/).

The original gotm/npzd model has been split into 4 components.
FABM is responsible for the coupling.

The next step would be to generalize the zooplankton to accept multiple prey types.
That then allows any number of phytoplankton types to be combined with any number
of zooplankton predators in fabm.yaml. For instance, 4 phytoplankton types being
eaten by a single zooplankton type. An example of this is available under
selma/zooplankton.F90.
