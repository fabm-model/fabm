Here you can find Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate how FABM can be accessed from Python.
For these, you need pyfabm. Instructions on how install pyfabm can be found at https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm/wiki/python.

Several utilities are installed together with pyfabm. The code for these is located at `<FABMDIR>/src/drivers/python/pyfabm/utils`.
